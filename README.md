# Maze Solver with Depth-First Search (DFS)

This Python project generates a maze using randomized cell configurations and solves it using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. It also visualizes the maze-solving process by demonstrating all the paths taken by the algorithm.

## Files Description

- **cell.py**: This file contains the implementation of a single cell with randomized walls. 
- **maze.py**: Here, cells are arranged to create the maze structure.
- **graphics.py**: This module is responsible for representing the visited cells by changing colors during DFS search for visualization purposes.
- **main.py**: The main implementation of the DFS algorithm on the maze and execution of the main algorithm.
- **test.py**: Implements test cases to ensure the correctness of the implemented algorithms.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Run `python main.py` to generate a maze and solve it using DFS.
5. You can also run `python test.py` to execute the test cases.
